<h4>The BBgoggles Project</h4>
<p>This project is based heavily on the <a href="https://github.com/deetch/goggles-experiment/">python project by deetch</a> and allows images to be sent from RIM Blackberry devices (tested working with JRE 6.0) to the Google Goggles server and the response parsed to give meaningful results.</p>
<p>This software is provided for the purposes of interoperability and is still in a beta stage, the software may be unstable on certain devices and under certain configurations and has not been widely tested.</p>
